# Installation

Clone the repo and submodules:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym.git
```

### Requirements

* Python 3.7/3.8
* Linux, macOS, or Windows with [Visual Studios 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/)
* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org//)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)

<!--- (See [installation instructions](#opengl-installation-on-unix-based-systems) on Unix based systems) --->

### Running with Docker

A Dockerfile is provided which can be used to build an image. Alternatively, a prebuilt version of this image is available on Dockerhub:

```shell
docker pull dennisgwilson/evogym
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 evoimage
```

Your container should include a python shell with evogym installed. To run using jupyter, find the container name (`docker ps`) and run the following:

```shell
docker exec <CONTAINER_NAME> jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
```

### Build and Install Package

To build the C++ simulation, build all the submodules, and install `evogym` run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
``` 

### Test Installation

cd to the `examples` folder and run the following script:

```shell
python gym_test.py
```

This script creates a random `5x5` robot in the `Walking-v0` environment. The robot is taking random actions. A window should open with a visualization of the environment -- kill the process from the terminal to close it.

<!--### OpenGL installation on Unix-based systems

To install OpenGL via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run the following commands:

```shell
brew install glfw
```
--->
